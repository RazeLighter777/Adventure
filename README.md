# Adventure
Adventure is a text-based console adventure RPG written in Java. It is extensible though plugins, has multiple clients (ssh and local terminal) and supports multi-player.
The game is written almost entirely from scratch as a programming exercise / personal project. It is released under the GPL V3.
# Progress
Currently, the game is in early development and has extremely limited functionality. See the issue board for progress reports, and commit history for the latest updates.\
There are no releases as of yet.
